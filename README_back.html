<p align="center">The project <strong>ArogyaKheti (Arogyaखेती)</strong> aims to provide a user-friendly and simple web
    interface for farmers of India to manage their day-to-day activities smartly. It was made as a project for <a

<h2 align="center">Problem Statement</h2>

<p align="center">
    <strong>Theme: Sustainability</strong>
    <br><br>
    In India, agriculture is considered as the primary source of income for the majority of the population. That
    basically concludes that agricultural sector is the most important sector in the nation. But, on the other hand,
    agriculture in
    India can be seen as one of the most unorganized sectors too. <strong>47% of the population</strong> in India is
    directly dependent
    on agriculture for their income. With such a great agricultural force, India would usually be expected to have
    negligible hunger and food security issues. But, unfortunately, that does not hold true. <strong>India ranks #107 on
        the Global
        Hunger Index</strong> and <strong>#68 in the Global Food Security Index</strong>. This is majorly because of the
    lack of proper management among the agricultural sector, especially in the case if small and medium farmers, who
    often end up taking wrong decisions due to less education or lack of information.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Our Solution</h2>
<p align="center">
    At <strong>ArogyaKheti</strong>, we aim to provide a solution to the problem through a combination of innovative
    technology and a deep understanding of the agricultural ecosystem. Our platform harnesses the power of data
    analytics, providing farmers with valuable insights into crop management, communication, and market trends. Our
    mission is to empower farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving agricultural
    landscape, ultimately contributing to food security and the eradication of hunger, formally addressing the [UN
    SDG](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)- <strong>Zero Hunger</strong>.
</p>
<p align="center">
<h3 align="center">An Insight to the SDG - Zero Hunger:</h3>

According to UN, by 2050, we will need to increase the world's food production by 70% to feed the world's population.
Even today, one in eight people of the world do not get enough food to eat. Technology can be used to address these
issues and help farmers to increase their productivity and reduce food waste.

<h3 align="center">Problem-based Analysis</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhancing Communication between Farmers: </strong> The ArogyaKheti forum plays a vital role in enhancing
        communication by
        providing a collaborative platform where farmers can share knowledge, exchange ideas, and discuss challenges. It
        facilitates the exchange of best practices, innovative techniques, and local wisdom, empowering farmers with
        valuable insights. By providing a space for open dialogue, the forum helps farmers learn from one another, stay
        updated on the latest agricultural trends, 1and collectively navigate obstacles.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Helping Farmers stay Updated: </strong> ArogyaKheti users are provided with curated news articles which
        play a crucial role in keeping
        farmers informed with timely and relevant updates on weather, market trends, farming schemes, and policy
        changes. It empowers farmers to make informed decisions, reduce risks, and optimize their resources, ultimately
        contributing to the sustainability of farming communities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Bridging the Gap between Consumers and Farmers: </strong> The public portal displaying the farmer's
        produce listings directly connects
        farmers with consumers, thereby eliminating the need for middlemen. It ensures transparency and fair pricing for
        both farmers and buyers. This direct interaction
        not only cuts down on unnecessary costs but also empowers farmers to have greater control over their income. It
        contributes to eradicating middlemen and fostering a more equitable and transparent agricultural ecosystem while
        supporting the economic well-being of farmers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Guiding Farmers to Make Calculated and Informed Decisions: </strong>Our Smart Crop and Fertilizer
        Recommendation Systems offer data-driven guidance to farmers. Both use Machine Learning with some real-time 
        data and soil health data to analyze and provide curated suggestions. Together, they maximize yields, reduce 
        waste, and promote sustainable farming.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>AI-enabled Support Channels: </strong>AI-powered Chatbots curated for farmers to help them with their
        queries and problems. This provides them a 24x7 support channel to get their queries resolved.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Farmers and Technology??: </strong> Whenever one associates the rural sector with technology, a major 
        question that arises is that how comfortable will they be?The ArogyaKheti platform is designed to be user-friendly and
        accessible to farmers of all ages and backgrounds. It is designed to be multi-lingual and is developed to be a Mobile-first
        application, taking in consideration that a computer would be a distant dream in such areas. The platform is 
        designed to be rather simple, intuitive and easy-to-use, ensuring that farmers can easily navigate the site 
        and access the information they need, without getting lost in the details.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Traditional Methods of Logging-In: </strong> In recent times, the Government of India has been pushing
        for the e-verification of Aadhar Cards and other such methods of authentication in Government sites. This system
        of carrying "Identity Cards" has rooted to a lot of people in the country, for whom we have introduced a system 
        of FIDC (Farmer's Identity Card). The ArogyaKheti platform is designed to be FIDC-Enabled, which means that farmers
        can easily log-in to the platform using their FIDC Cards. But you might be wondering what FIDC is? It is a bit 
        project specific in this case. No such card exists in real life, but it is a concept that we have visualized hypothetically, where
        FIDCs are cards that are issued to farmers by the Government of India, which contain their basic information along with their farm 
        ownership details. tl;dr it is basically a substitute for Aadhar Card/Pan Card in this case.
