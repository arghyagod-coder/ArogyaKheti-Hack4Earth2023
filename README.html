<h2 align="center">Problem Statement</h2>

<p align="center">
    <strong>Theme: Sustainability</strong>
    <br><br>
    In India, agriculture is considered as the primary source of income for the majority of the population. That
    basically concludes that agricultural sector is the most important sector in the nation. But, on the other hand,
    agriculture in
    India can be seen as one of the most unorganized sectors too. <strong>47% of the population</strong> in India is
    directly dependent
    on agriculture for their income. With such a great agricultural force, India would usually be expected to have
    negligible hunger and food security issues. But, unfortunately, that does not hold true. <strong>India ranks #107 on
        the Global
        Hunger Index</strong> and <strong>#68 in the Global Food Security Index</strong>. This is majorly because of the
    lack of proper management among the agricultural sector, especially in the case if small and medium farmers, who
    often end up taking wrong decisions due to less education or lack of information.

    technology and a deep understanding of the agricultural ecosystem. Our platform harnesses the power of data
    analytics, providing farmers with valuable insights into crop management, communication, and market trends. Our
    mission is to empower farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving agricultural

<h3 align="center">An Insight to the SDG - Zero Hunger:</h3>

According to UN, by 2050, we will need to increase the world's food production by 70% to feed the world's population.
Even today, one in eight people of the world do not get enough food to eat. Technology can be used to address these
issues and help farmers to increase their productivity and reduce food waste.
