            <a href="/admin/public/">The public portal</a> is a place where farmers like you can reach a wider
            audience on reasonable prices by listing down your produce-related information publicly. Here, you have the
            opportunity
            to present your nurtured crops, livestock, and
            agricultural products to potential buyers and enthusiasts. Create your listings with care, offering proper
            names, pricing, and the quantities available. Your contributions are vital to our agricultural
            community, and by listing your produce here, you're opening the door to connections with consumers who value
            and
            support local agriculture. Share your harvest with the world and reap the rewards of your hard work.
